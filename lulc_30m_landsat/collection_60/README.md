## About
This folder contains the scripts used to classify and filter land use and land cover data for the **Cerrado** biome.

For detailed information about the classification process and methodology, refer to the Cerrado biome appendix in the [Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD)](https://mapbiomas.org/download-dos-atbds).

## How to use

5. Download or clone this repository to your local workspace.

## Workflow
The project is organized into folders representing key steps of the Cerrado biome classification schema. Each folder contains scripts relevant to a specific processing stage:

1. [Feature space selection](https://github.com/mapbiomas/brazil-cerrado/tree/main/lulc_30m_landsat/collection_60/1-feature-space)

2. [General map classification](https://github.com/mapbiomas/brazil-cerrado/tree/main/lulc_30m_landsat/collection_60/2-general-map)

3. [Wetlands classification](https://github.com/mapbiomas/brazil-cerrado/tree/main/lulc_30m_landsat/collection_60/3-wetlands)

4. [Integration of maps](https://github.com/mapbiomas/brazil-cerrado/tree/main/lulc_30m_landsat/collection_60/4-integrate-map)
